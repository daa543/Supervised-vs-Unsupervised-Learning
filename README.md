# Supervised-vs-Unsupervised-Learning

We used heart_2020_cleaned dataset to explore and analyze using both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning. We built two models using supervised learning algorithms and two models using unsupervised learning methods.

The goal was to compare the performance of each set of models, analyzing the results and providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
